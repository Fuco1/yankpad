#+TITLE:yankpad.el

Let's say that you have text snippets that you want to paste, but that [[http://capitaomorte.github.io/yasnippet/][yasnippet]]
or [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SkeletonMode][skeleton]] is a bit too much when you do not need a shortcut/abbrev for your
snippet. You like org-mode, so why not write your snippets there? Introducing
the yankpad:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Category 1

  ,** Snippet title

      Here's a text snippet I want to insert.

  ,** List snippet

      And here's another one, with a list.

      - I like snippets
      - They are great!

  ,* Category 2

  ,** Explaining categories

      This snippet belongs to another category. Categories are useful if you need
      several yankpads, for instance if you're a teacher (like me) working with
      different courses.

  ,** yasnippet magic

      If you have yasnippet installed (not required), the content in each snippet
      is actually executed by yasnippet! This means that you could run elisp
      inside your snippets: `(+ 3 4)` and have handy tab stop fields.

      | Student | Grade |
      |---------+-------|
      | $1      | $2    |

      That's pretty handy!
      $0

  ,* org-mode

  ,** Major-mode categories

  If you have a category with the same name as a major-mode, that category will be
  activated when switching major-mode. This only affects the local buffer and does
  not modify the global category.
#+END_SRC

* Setup

1. Add =yankpad.el= to your load-path and require it.
2. The default location for the yankpad file is =yankpad.org= in your =org-directory=. This can be changed by modifying the =yankpad-file= variable.
3. That's it!

* Usage

1. Add entries to your =yankpad-file=. Level 1 headings are categories and level 2 headings are snippets.
2. Insert a snippet with =M-x yankpad-insert=.
3. If you want to change category, use =M-x yankpad-set-category=. If you have a category with the same name as a major-mode (for instance =org-mode=), that category will be locally set when switching major-mode.
4. To quickly open your =yankpad-file= for editing, run =M-x yankpad-edit=.
